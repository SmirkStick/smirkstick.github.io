                <h1>Folklore Hunter Creature Vote</h1>
                <p>As a thank you from the team at Liquid Donkey Games, we want to give you, the player, the ability to vote on the third hunt in Folklore Hunter.</p>
                <p>We've had the Wendigo in 'Night of the Wendigo' and the Vampiric Strigoi in 'Bloodfang Forest'. Now, we want to hear what you think the third cryptid should be.</p>
                <p>We've compiled a list of three of the most commonly suggested cryptids that we feel would be a good fit for the game. We've decided to exclude a few cryptids that are the primary focus of other recent games similar to Folklore Hunter (namely, Bigfoot/Yeti and the Skinwalker). </p>
